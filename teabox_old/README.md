# TeaBox
## The project is not finished and, accordingly, this is not the final (currently working in certain conditions) version.
## This app is for our "Smart Kettle" project.
### Its functionality includes:
1. Connecting to a remote server created by the microcontroller and interacting with it (receiving and sending requests);
2. turning the power supply on and off;
3. display information about the state of the power supply.
### In the future it is planned:
1. Water temperature display;
2. water quantity display;
3. (probably) the ability to connect to a specific server;
4. (probably) cosmetic tweaks;
5. notification system;
6. widget.
